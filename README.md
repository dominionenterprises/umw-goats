## Usage

The program uses API to provide readable information to the user, using a Heroku instance.
The program imports and uses API from, Yelp, Zillow, Your Mapper Crime Score, and Google.

To use the sample of the program input a zip code search, the program will return to you the ability to see what restraunts are in that area, what shops, houses, nightlife, attractions and the crime rates of the area. 

The GUI will display a actively updating map for traffic and will display heat maps for crime. It will display pinpoints for restraunts and the like. There are active buttons to manuver between the display categories. The GUI also has an overall quality of life for the area.
